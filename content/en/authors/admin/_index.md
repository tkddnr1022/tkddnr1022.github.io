I am majoring in computer engineering at Jeonbuk National University. I have been interested in web development since I was a freshman, and after starting to study with Apache+MySQL+PHP stack, I am currently studying React, React Native, and Nest.js.

I prefer individual development and full stack, but I always learn a lot from other people's work. I have a strong **product maker** tendency, so I always think about user experience during the development process. I am aiming for OOP, and I am studying service design and infrastructure knowledge in my spare time to become a better developer.
